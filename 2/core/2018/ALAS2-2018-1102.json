			"title": "Amazon Linux 2 2017.12 - ALAS2-2018-1102: medium priority package update for openssl",
			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2018-0739:\n\tConstructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition (such as can be found in PKCS7) could eventually exceed the stack given malicious input with excessive recursion. This could result in a Denial Of Service attack. There are no such structures used within SSL/TLS that come from untrusted sources so this is considered safe. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0h (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0g). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2o (Affected 1.0.2b-1.0.2n).\n1561266: \nCVE-2018-0739 openssl: Handling of crafted recursive ASN.1 structures can cause a stack overflow and resulting denial of service\n\nCVE-2018-0732:\n\tDuring key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based ciphersuite a malicious server can send a very large prime value to the client. This will cause the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has finished. This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0i-dev (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2p-dev (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2o).\n1591100: \nCVE-2018-0732 openssl: Malicious server can send large prime to client during DH(E) TLS handshake causing the client to hang\n\nCVE-2018-0495:\n\tLibgcrypt before 1.7.10 and 1.8.x before 1.8.3 allows a memory-cache side-channel attack on ECDSA signatures that can be mitigated through the use of blinding during the signing process in the _gcry_ecc_ecdsa_sign function in cipher/ecc-ecdsa.c, aka the Return Of the Hidden Number Problem or ROHNP. To discover an ECDSA key, the attacker needs access to either the local machine or a different virtual machine on the same physical host.\n1591163: \nCVE-2018-0495 openssl: ROHNP - Key Extraction Side Channel in Multiple Crypto Libraries\n\nCVE-2017-3735:\n\tWhile parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate, it is possible to do a one-byte overread. This would result in an incorrect text display of the certificate. This bug has been present since 2006 and is present in all versions of OpenSSL before 1.0.2m and 1.1.0g.\n1486144: \nCVE-2017-3735 openssl: Malformed X.509 IPAdressFamily could cause OOB read\n",
