			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2017-6464:\n\tA vulnerability was discovered in the NTP server&#039;s parsing of configuration directives. A remote, authenticated attacker could cause ntpd to crash by sending a crafted message.\n1433987: \nCVE-2017-6464 ntp: Denial of Service via Malformed Config\n\nCVE-2017-6463:\n\tA vulnerability was discovered in the NTP server&#039;s parsing of configuration directives. A remote, authenticated attacker could cause ntpd to crash by sending a crafted message.\n1434002: \nCVE-2017-6463 ntp: Authenticated DoS via Malicious Config Option\n\nCVE-2017-6462:\n\tA vulnerability was found in NTP, in the parsing of packets from the /dev/datum device. A malicious device could send crafted messages, causing ntpd to crash.\n1433995: \nCVE-2017-6462 ntp: Buffer Overflow in DPTS Clock\n\nCVE-2016-9311:\n\tA flaw was found in the way ntpd implemented the trap service. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted packet to cause a null pointer dereference that will crash ntpd, resulting in a denial of service.\n1398350: \nCVE-2016-9311 ntp: Null pointer dereference when trap service is enabled\n\nCVE-2016-9310:\n\tA flaw was found in the control mode functionality of ntpd. A remote attacker could send a crafted control mode packet which could lead to information disclosure or result in DDoS amplification attacks.\n1397319: \nCVE-2016-9310 ntp: Mode 6 unauthenticated trap information disclosure and DDoS vector\n\nCVE-2016-7433:\n\tA flaw was found in the way ntpd calculated the root delay. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted spoofed packet to cause denial of service or in some special cases even crash.\n1397347: \nCVE-2016-7433 ntp: Broken initial sync calculations regression\n\nCVE-2016-7429:\n\tA flaw was found in the way ntpd running on a host with multiple network interfaces handled certain server responses. A remote attacker could use this flaw which would cause ntpd to not synchronize with the source.\n1397341: \nCVE-2016-7429 ntp: Attack on interface selection\n\nCVE-2016-7426:\n\tIt was found that when ntp is configured with rate limiting for all associations the limits are also applied to responses received from its configured sources. A remote attacker who knows the sources can cause a denial of service by preventing ntpd from accepting valid responses from its sources.\n1397345: \nCVE-2016-7426 ntp: Client rate limiting and server responses\n",
