			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2019-14906:\n\tA flaw was found with the RHSA-2019:3950 erratum, where it did not fix the CVE-2019-13616 SDL vulnerability. A heap-based buffer overflow flaw, in SDL while copying an existing surface into a new optimized one, due to a lack of validation while loading a BMP image, is possible. An application that uses SDL to parse untrusted input files may be vulnerable to this flaw, which could allow an attacker to make the application crash or execute code.\n1777372: \nCVE-2019-14906 SDL: CVE-2019-13616 not fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 erratum RHSA-2019:3950\n    \n\nCVE-2019-13616:\n\tSDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) through 1.2.15 and 2.x through 2.0.9 has a heap-based buffer over-read in BlitNtoN in video/SDL_blit_N.c when called from SDL_SoftBlit in video/SDL_blit.c.\nA heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in SDL in the SDL_BlitCopy() function, that was called while copying an existing surface into a new optimized one, due to lack of validation while loading a BMP image in the SDL_LoadBMP_RW() function.
