			"title": "Amazon Linux 2 2017.12 - ALAS2-2021-1598: important priority package update for ghostscript",
			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2019-6116:\n\tIt was found that ghostscript could leak sensitive operators on the operand stack when a pseudo-operator pushes a subroutine. A specially crafted PostScript file could use this flaw to escape the -dSAFER protection in order to, for example, have access to the file system outside of the SAFER constraints.\n1666636: CVE-2019-6116 ghostscript: subroutines within pseudo-operators must themselves be pseudo-operators (700317)\n\nCVE-2019-3839:\n\tIt was found that some privileged operators remained accessible from various places after the CVE-2019-6116 fix. A specially crafted PostScript file could use this flaw in order to, for example, have access to the file system outside of the constrains imposed by -dSAFER.\n1673304: CVE-2019-3839 ghostscript: missing attack vector protections for CVE-2019-6116\n\nCVE-2019-3838:\n\tIt was found that the forceput operator could be extracted from the DefineResource method. A specially crafted PostScript file could use this flaw in order to, for example, have access to the file system outside of the constrains imposed by -dSAFER.\n1677581: CVE-2019-3838 ghostscript: forceput in DefineResource is still accessible (700576)\n\nCVE-2019-3835:\n\tIt was found that the superexec operator was available in the internal dictionary.  A specially crafted PostScript file could use this flaw in order to, for example, have access to the file system outside of the constrains imposed by -dSAFER.\n1677588: CVE-2019-3835 ghostscript: superexec operator is available (700585)\n\nCVE-2019-14869:\n\tA flaw was found in the `.charkeys` procedure, where it did not properly secure its privileged calls, enabling scripts to bypass `-dSAFER` restrictions. An attacker could abuse this flaw by creating a specially crafted PostScript file that could escalate privileges within the Ghostscript and access files outside of restricted areas or execute commands.\n1768911: CVE-2019-14869 ghostscript: -dSAFER escape in .charkeys (701841)\n\nCVE-2019-14817:\n\tA flaw was found in the .pdfexectoken and other procedures where it did not properly secure its privileged calls, enabling scripts to bypass `-dSAFER` restrictions. A specially crafted PostScript file could disable security protection and then have access to the file system, or execute arbitrary commands.\n1744042: CVE-2019-14817 ghostscript: Safer mode bypass by .forceput exposure in .pdfexectoken and other procedures (701450)\n\nCVE-2019-14813:\n\tA flaw was found in the setsystemparams procedure where it did not properly secure its privileged calls, enabling scripts to bypass `-dSAFER` restrictions. A specially crafted PostScript file could disable security protection and then have access to the file system, or execute arbitrary commands.\n1743737: CVE-2019-14813 ghostscript: Safer mode bypass by .forceput exposure in setsystemparams (701443)\n\nCVE-2019-14812:\n\tA flaw was found in the .setuserparams2 procedure where it did not properly secure its privileged calls, enabling scripts to bypass `-dSAFER` restrictions. A specially crafted PostScript file could disable security protection and then have access to the file system, or execute arbitrary commands.\n1743754: CVE-2019-14812 ghostscript: Safer mode bypass by .forceput exposure in setuserparams (701444)\n\nCVE-2019-14811:\n\tA flaw was found in the .pdf_hook_DSC_Creator procedure where it did not properly secure its privileged calls, enabling scripts to bypass `-dSAFER` restrictions. A specially crafted PostScript file could disable security protection and then have access to the file system, or execute arbitrary commands.\n1743757: CVE-2019-14811 ghostscript: Safer mode bypass by .forceput exposure in .pdf_hook_DSC_Creator (701445)\n\nCVE-2018-19477:\n\tpsi/zfjbig2.c in Artifex Ghostscript before 9.26 allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions because of a JBIG2Decode type confusion.\n1654468: CVE-2018-19477 ghostscript: access bypass in psi/zfjbig2.c (700168)\n\nCVE-2018-19476:\n\tpsi/zicc.c in Artifex Ghostscript before 9.26 allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions because of a setcolorspace type confusion.\n1654464: CVE-2018-19476 ghostscript: access bypass in psi/zicc.c (700169)\n\nCVE-2018-19475:\n\tpsi/zdevice2.c in Artifex Ghostscript before 9.26 allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions because available stack space is not checked when the device remains the same.\n1654459: CVE-2018-19475 ghostscript: access bypass in psi/zdevice2.c (700153)\n\nCVE-2018-19409:\n\tAn issue was discovered in Artifex Ghostscript before 9.26. LockSafetyParams is not checked correctly if another device is used.\n1652583: CVE-2018-19409 ghostscript: Improperly implemented security check in zsetdevice function in psi/zdevice.c\n\nCVE-2018-19134:\n\tIn Artifex Ghostscript through 9.25, the setpattern operator did not properly validate certain types. A specially crafted PostScript document could exploit this to crash Ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the context of the Ghostscript process. This is a type confusion issue because of failure to check whether the Implementation of a pattern dictionary was a structure type.\n1655599: CVE-2018-19134 ghostscript: Type confusion in setpattern (700141)\n\nCVE-2018-18284:\n\tArtifex Ghostscript 9.25 and earlier allows attackers to bypass a sandbox protection mechanism via vectors involving the 1Policy operator.\n1642940: CVE-2018-18284 ghostscript: 1Policy operator allows a sandbox protection bypass\n\nCVE-2018-18073:\n\tArtifex Ghostscript allows attackers to bypass a sandbox protection mechanism by leveraging exposure of system operators in the saved execution stack in an error object.\n1642584: CVE-2018-18073 ghostscript: Saved execution stacks can leak operator arrays\n\nCVE-2018-17961:\n\tArtifex Ghostscript 9.25 and earlier allows attackers to bypass a sandbox protection mechanism via vectors involving errorhandler setup. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-17183.\n1642578: CVE-2018-17961 ghostscript: Saved execution stacks can leak operator arrays (incomplete fix for CVE-2018-17183)\n\nCVE-2018-17183:\n\tArtifex Ghostscript before 9.25 allowed a user-writable error exception table, which could be used by remote attackers able to supply crafted PostScript to potentially overwrite or replace error handlers to inject code.\n1632471: CVE-2018-17183 ghostscript: User-writable error exception table\n",
