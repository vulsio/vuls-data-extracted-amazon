Depending on the instance configuration, a remote or local attacker may abuse this vulnerability to guess the password of the victim user.\n1798728: CVE-2020-8632 cloud-init: Too short random password length in cc_set_password in config/cc_set_passwords.py\n\nCVE-2020-8631:\n\tA flaw was found in cloud-init, where it uses the random.choice function when creating sensitive random strings used for generating a random password in new instances. Depending on the instance configuration, a remote or local attacker may abuse this vulnerability to guess the password of the victim user.\n1798731: CVE-2020-8631 cloud-init: Use of random.choice when generating random password\n\nCVE-2018-10896:\n\tThe default cloud-init configuration included \"ssh_deletekeys: 0\", disabling cloud-init's deletion of ssh host keys. In some environments, this could lead to instances created by cloning a golden master or template system, sharing ssh host keys, and being able to impersonate one another or conduct man-in-the-middle attacks.\n1598831: CVE-2018-10896 cloud-init: default configuration disabled deletion of SSH host keys\n",
