This could have led to a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2023-5725:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nA malicious installed WebExtension could open arbitrary URLs, which under the right circumstance could be leveraged to collect sensitive user data.\n\nCVE-2023-5724:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nDrivers are not always robust to extremely large draw calls and in some cases this scenario could have led to a crash.\n\nCVE-2023-5721:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nIt was possible for certain browser prompts and dialogs to be activated or dismissed unintentionally by the user due to an insufficient activation-delay.\n",
