			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-2977:\n\tA vulnerbility was found in OpenSC. This security flaw cause a buffer overrun vulnerability in pkcs15 cardos_have_verifyrc_package. The attacker can supply a smart card package with malformed ASN1 context. The cardos_have_verifyrc_package function scans the ASN1 buffer for 2 tags, where remaining length is wrongly caculated due to moved starting pointer. This leads to possible heap-based buffer oob read. In cases where ASAN is enabled while compiling this causes a crash. Further info leak or more damage is possible.\n\nCVE-2021-42782:\n\tStack buffer overflow issues were found in Opensc before version 0.22.0 in various places that could potentially crash programs using the library.\n\nCVE-2021-42781:\n\tHeap buffer overflow issues were found in Opensc before version 0.22.0 in pkcs15-oberthur.c that could potentially crash programs using the library.\n\nCVE-2021-42780:\n\tA use after return issue was found in Opensc before version 0.22.0 in insert_pin function that could potentially crash programs using the library.\n\nCVE-2021-42779:\n\tA heap use after free issue was found in Opensc before version 0.22.0 in sc_file_valid.\n",
