			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-2869:\n\tA flaw was found in libtiff's tiffcrop tool that has a uint32_t underflow, which leads to an out-of-bounds read and write in the extractContigSamples8bits routine. This flaw allows an attacker who supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop to trick a user into opening the crafted file with tiffcrop, causing a crash or potential further exploitations.\n\nCVE-2022-2868:\n\tlibtiff's tiffcrop utility has a improper input validation flaw that can lead to out of bounds read and ultimately cause a crash if an attacker is able to supply a crafted file to tiffcrop.\n\nCVE-2022-2867:\n\tA flaw was found in libtiffs tiffcrop utility that has a uint32_t underflow that can lead to an out-of-bounds read and write. This flaw allows an attacker who supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop to cause a crash or, in some cases, further exploitation.\n",
