			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 - Kernel-5.15 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-3812:\n\tAn out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TUN/TAP device driver functionality in how a user generates a malicious (too big) networking packet when napi frags is enabled. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2023-0590:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in qdisc_graft in net/sched/sch_api.c in the Linux Kernel due to a race problem. This flaw leads to a denial of service issue.\n\nCVE-2022-3623:\n\tA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function follow_page_pte of the file mm/gup.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to race condition. The attack can be launched remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211921 was assigned to this vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2022-3619:\n\tA vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function l2cap_recv_acldata of the file net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211918 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2022-3564:\n\tA vulnerability classified as critical was found in Linux Kernel. Affected by this vulnerability is the function l2cap_reassemble_sdu of the file net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211087.\n\nCVE-2022-3543:\n\tA vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Linux Kernel. This issue affects the function unix_sock_destructor/unix_release_sock of the file net/unix/af_unix.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211043.\n\nCVE-2022-3524:\n\tA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function ipv6_renew_options of the component IPv6 Handler. The manipulation leads to memory leak. The attack can be launched remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211021 was assigned to this vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2022-3435:\n\tA vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in Linux Kernel. This affects the function fib_nh_match of the file net/ipv4/fib_semantics.c of the component IPv4 Handler. The manipulation leads to out-of-bounds read. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-210357 was assigned to this vulnerability.\n",
