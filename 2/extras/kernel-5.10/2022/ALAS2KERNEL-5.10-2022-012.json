			"title": "Amazon Linux 2 - Kernel-5.10 2.0 - ALAS2KERNEL-5.10-2022-012: important priority package update for kernel",
			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 - Kernel-5.10 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-27666:\n\tA heap buffer overflow flaw was found in IPsec ESP transformation code in net/ipv4/esp4.c and net/ipv6/esp6.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with a normal user privilege to overwrite kernel heap objects and may cause a local privilege escalation threat.\n\nCVE-2022-25636:\n\tAn out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in nft_fwd_dup_netdev_offload in net/netfilter/nf_dup_netdev.c in the netfilter subcomponent in the Linux kernel due to a heap out-of-bounds write problem. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user account on the system to gain access to out-of-bounds memory, leading to a system crash or a privilege escalation threat.\n\nCVE-2022-23960:\n\tThe Amazon Linux kernel now enables, by default, a software mitigation for this issue, on all ARM-based EC2 instance types.\n\nCVE-2022-23042:\n\tLinux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Several Linux PV device frontends are using the grant table interfaces for removing access rights of the backends in ways being subject to race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the gntalloc driver are testing whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case, they assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be used after the frontend I/O has finished. The xenbus driver has a similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing the granted access of a shared ring buffer. blkfront: CVE-2022-23036 netfront: CVE-2022-23037 scsifront: CVE-2022-23038 gntalloc: CVE-2022-23039 xenbus: CVE-2022-23040 blkfront, netfront, scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus, 9p, kbdfront, and pvcalls are using a functionality to delay freeing a grant reference until it is no longer in use, but the freeing of the related data page is not synchronized with dropping the granted access. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page even after it has been freed and then re-used for a different purpose. CVE-2022-23041 netfront will fail a BUG_ON() assertion if it fails to revoke access in the rx path. This will result in a Denial of Service (DoS) situation of the guest which can be triggered by the backend.

CVE-2022-23042\n\nCVE-2022-1016:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel in net/netfilter/nf_tables_core.c:nft_do_chain, which can cause a use-after-free. This issue needs to handle return with proper preconditions, as it can lead to a kernel information leak problem caused by a local, unprivileged attacker.\n\nCVE-2022-1015:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel in linux/net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c of the netfilter subsystem. This flaw allows a local user to cause an out-of-bounds write issue.\n\nCVE-2022-1011:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's FUSE filesystem in the way a user triggers write(). This flaw allows a local user to gain unauthorized access to data from the FUSE filesystem, resulting in privilege escalation.\n\nCVE-2022-0500:\n\tA flaw was found in unrestricted eBPF usage by the BPF_BTF_LOAD, leading to a possible out-of-bounds memory write in the Linux kernel's BPF subsystem due to the way a user loads BTF. This flaw allows a local user to crash or escalate their privileges on the system.\n",
