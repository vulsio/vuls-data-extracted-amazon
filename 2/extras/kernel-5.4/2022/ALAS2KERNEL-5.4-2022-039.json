			"title": "Amazon Linux 2 - Kernel-5.4 2.0 - ALAS2KERNEL-5.4-2022-039: important priority package update for kernel",
			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 - Kernel-5.4 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-3812:\n\tAn out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TUN/TAP device driver functionality in how a user generates a malicious (too big) networking packet when napi frags is enabled. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2022-41850:\n\troccat_report_event in drivers/hid/hid-roccat.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition and resultant use-after-free in certain situations where a report is received while copying a report->value is in progress.\n\nCVE-2022-41849:\n\tdrivers/video/fbdev/smscufx.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition and resultant use-after-free if a physically proximate attacker removes a USB device while calling open(), aka a race condition between ufx_ops_open and ufx_usb_disconnect.\n\nCVE-2022-3649:\n\tA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function nilfs_new_inode of the file fs/nilfs2/inode.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211992.\n\nCVE-2022-3594:\n\tA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function intr_callback of the file drivers/net/usb/r8152.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to logging of excessive data. The attack can be launched remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211363.\n\nCVE-2022-3565:\n\tA vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Linux Kernel. Affected by this issue is the function del_timer of the file drivers/isdn/mISDN/l1oip_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211088.\n\nCVE-2022-3564:\n\tA vulnerability classified as critical was found in Linux Kernel. Affected by this vulnerability is the function l2cap_reassemble_sdu of the file net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211087.\n\nCVE-2022-3542:\n\tA vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Linux Kernel. This vulnerability affects the function bnx2x_tpa_stop of the file drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x_cmn.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211042 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2022-3535:\n\tA vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Linux Kernel. Affected by this vulnerability is the function mvpp2_dbgfs_port_init of the file drivers/net/ethernet/marvell/mvpp2/mvpp2_debugfs.c of the component mvpp2. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211033 was assigned to this vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2022-3524:\n\tA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function ipv6_renew_options of the component IPv6 Handler. The manipulation leads to memory leak. The attack can be launched remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211021 was assigned to this vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2022-2602:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Unix socket Garbage Collection and io_uring. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2021-3759:\n\tA memory overflow vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's ipc functionality of the memcg subsystem, in the way a user calls the semget function multiple times, creating semaphores. This flaw allows a local user to starve the resources, causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n",
