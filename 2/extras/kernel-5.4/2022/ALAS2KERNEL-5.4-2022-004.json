			"title": "Amazon Linux 2 - Kernel-5.4 2.0 - ALAS2KERNEL-5.4-2022-004: important priority package update for kernel",
			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 - Kernel-5.4 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-38208:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernels NFC implementation, A NULL pointer dereference and BUG leading to a denial of service can be triggered by a local unprivileged user causing a kernel panic.\n\nCVE-2021-3573:\n\tA flaw use-after-free in function hci_sock_bound_ioctl() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the way user calls ioct HCIUNBLOCKADDR or other way triggers race condition of the call hci_unregister_dev() together with one of the calls hci_sock_blacklist_add(), hci_sock_blacklist_del(), hci_get_conn_info(), hci_get_auth_info(). A privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2021-3564:\n\tA flaw double-free memory corruption in the Linux kernel HCI device initialization subsystem was found in the way user attach malicious HCI TTY Bluetooth device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.\n\nCVE-2021-3506:\n\tAn out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in fs/f2fs/node.c in the f2fs module in the Linux kernel. A bounds check failure allows a local attacker to gain access to out-of-bounds memory leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-34693:\n\tThe canbus filesystem in the Linux kernel contains an information leak of kernel memory to devices on the CAN bus network link layer.  An attacker with the ability to dump messages on the CAN bus is able to learn of uninitialized stack values by dumbing messages on the can bus.\n\nCVE-2021-33034:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in hci_send_acl in the bluetooth host controller interface (HCI) in Linux kernel, where a local attacker with an access rights could cause a denial of service problem on the system  The issue results from the object hchan, freed in hci_disconn_loglink_complete_evt, yet still used in other places. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity, confidentiality and system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-32399:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handling of the removal of Bluetooth HCI controllers. This flaw allows an attacker with a local account to exploit a race condition, leading to corrupted memory and possible privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-22543:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's KVM implementation, where improper handing of the VM_IO|VM_PFNMAP VMAs in KVM bypasses RO checks and leads to pages being freed while still accessible by the VMM and guest. This flaw allows users who can start and control a VM to read/write random pages of memory, resulting in local privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-0129:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. Improper access control in BlueZ may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via adjacent access. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\nCVE-2020-26558:\n\tA vulnerability was found in the bluez, where Passkey Entry protocol used in Secure Simple Pairing (SSP), Secure Connections (SC) and LE Secure Connections (LESC) of the Bluetooth Core Specification is vulnerable to an impersonation attack where an active attacker can impersonate the initiating device without any previous knowledge.\n\nCVE-2020-26541:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel in certs/blacklist.c, When signature entries for EFI_CERT_X509_GUID are contained in the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database, the entries are skipped. This can cause a security threat and breach system integrity, confidentiality and even lead to a denial of service problem.\n\nCVE-2020-26147:\n\tA flaw was found in ieee80211_rx_h_defragment in net/mac80211/rx.c in the Linux Kernel's WiFi implementation. This vulnerability can be abused to inject packets or exfiltrate selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames, and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity.\n\nCVE-2020-26145:\n\tA flaw was found in ath10k_htt_rx_proc_rx_frag_ind_hl in drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/htt_rx.c in the Linux kernel WiFi implementations, where it accepts a second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments even when sent in plaintext and then process them as full unfragmented frames. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity.\n\nCVE-2020-26141:\n\tA vulnerability was found in Linux kernel's WiFi implementation.  An attacker within wireless range can inject a control packet fragment where the kernel does not verify the Message Integrity Check (authenticity) of fragmented TKIP frames.\n\nCVE-2020-26139:\n\tFrames used for authentication and key management between the AP and connected clients.  Some clients may take these redirected frames masquerading as control mechanisms from the AP.\n\nCVE-2020-24588:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernels wifi implementation. An attacker within wireless broadcast range can inject custom data into the wireless communication circumventing checks on the data.  This can cause the frame to pass checks and be considered a valid frame of a different type.\n\nCVE-2020-24587:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's WiFi implementation. An attacker within the wireless range can abuse a logic flaw in the WiFi implementation by reassembling packets from multiple fragments under different keys, treating them as valid. This flaw allows an attacker to send a fragment under an incorrect key, treating them as a valid fragment under the new key. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\nCVE-2020-24586:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of wifi fragmentation handling. An attacker with the ability to transmit within the wireless transmission range of an access point can abuse a flaw where previous contents of wifi fragments can be unintentionally transmitted to another device.\n",
