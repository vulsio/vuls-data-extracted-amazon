			"title": "Amazon Linux 2022 - ALAS2022-2022-077: Medium priority package update for vim",
			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2022 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-1420:\n\tA vulnerability was found in Vim. The issue occurs when using a number in a string for the lambda name, triggering an out-of-range pointer offset vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a crafted script containing an argument as a number and then using it as a string pointer to access any memory location, causing an application to crash and possibly access some memory.\n\nCVE-2022-1381:\n\tA global heap buffer overflow vulnerability was found in vim's skip_range() function of the src/ex_docmd.c file. This flaw occurs because vim uses an invalid pointer with V: in Ex mode. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap buffer overflow that causes an application to crash, leading to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-1160:\n\tA heap buffer overflow flaw was found in vim's get_one_sourceline() function of scriptfile.c file. This flaw occurs when source can read past the end of the copied line. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a crafted file, triggering a heap-overflow and causing an application to crash, which leads to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-1154:\n\tA heap use-after-free vulnerability was found in Vim's utf_ptr2char() function of the src/mbyte.c file. This flaw occurs because vim is using a buffer line after it has been freed in the old regexp engine. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap use-after-free that causes an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-0943:\n\tA heap buffer overflow flaw was found in vim's suggest_try_change() function of the spellsuggest.c file. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a crafted file, triggering a heap-overflow and causing an application to crash, which leads to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-0729:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to crashes within specific regexp patterns and strings and leads to an out-of-range vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0714:\n\tA heap-buffer-overflow flaw was found in vim's win_lbr_chartabsize() function of charset.c file. The issue occurs due to an incorrect 'vartabstop' value. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap-overflow, and can cause an application to crash, eventually leading to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-0696:\n\tA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in vim's find_ucmd() function of usercmd.c file. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a crafted file, triggering a NULL pointer dereference. This issue leads to an application crash, causing a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-0685:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to a crash when using a special multi-byte character and leads to an out-of-range vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0629:\n\tA stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in vim's ga_concat_shorten_esc() function of src/testing.c file. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a crafted file, triggering a stack-overflow. This issue can lead to an application crash, causing a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-0572:\n\tA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in vim's ex_retab() function of indent.c file. This flaw occurs when repeatedly using :retab. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a crafted file triggering a heap-overflow.\n\nCVE-2022-0554:\n\tA flaw was found in vim that causes an out-of-range pointer offset vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0417:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to illegal memory access and leads to a heap buffer overflow. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0413:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to using freed memory when the substitute uses a recursive function call, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0408:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to stack corruption when looking for spell suggestions and leads to a stack buffer overflow. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0393:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to a crash when recording and using Select mode and leads to an out-of-bounds read. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n",
