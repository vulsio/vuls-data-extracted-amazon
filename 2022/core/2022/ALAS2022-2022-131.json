This issue occurs because an already freed memory is used when a specially crafted input is processed. This flaw allows an attacker who can trick a user into opening a specially crafted file into triggering the use-after-free, causing the application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-2874:\n\tNULL Pointer Dereference in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0224.\n\nCVE-2022-2862:\n\tUse After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0221.\n\nCVE-2022-2849:\n\tHeap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0220.\n\nCVE-2022-2845:\n\tBuffer Over-read in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0218.\n\nCVE-2022-2819:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to illegal memory access and leads to a heap buffer overflow vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-2817:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability was found in Vim in the string_quote function in the strings.c file. This issue occurs because an already freed memory is used when a specially crafted input is processed. This flaw allows an attacker who can trick a user into opening a specially crafted file into triggering the use-after-free, causing the application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-2816:\n\tAn out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in Vim in the check_vim9_unlet function in the vim9cmds.c file. This issue occurs because of invalid memory access when compiling the unlet command when a specially crafted input is processed. This flaw allows an attacker who can trick a user into opening a specially crafted file into triggering the out-of-bounds read, causing the application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-2598:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to Illegal memory access and leads to a heap buffer overflow vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-2581:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to illegal memory access and leads to a heap buffer overflow. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-2580:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to illegal memory access and leads to a heap buffer overflow. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-2571:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to illegal memory access and leads to a heap buffer overflow vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-2522:\n\tA heap buffer overflow vulnerability was found in vim's ins_compl_infercase_gettext() function of the src/insexpand.c file. This flaw occurs when vim tries to access uninitialized memory when completing a long line. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap-based buffer overflow that causes an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-2345:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability was found in Vim in the skipwhite function in the charset.c file. This issue occurs because an already freed memory is used when a specially crafted input is processed. This flaw allows an attacker who can trick a user into opening a specially crafted file into triggering the use-after-free, and cause the application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-2344:\n\tA heap-based buffer overflow was found in Vim in the ins_compl_add function in the insexpand.c file. This issue occurs due to a read past the end of a buffer when a specially crafted input is processed. This flaw allows an attacker who can trick a user into opening a specially crafted file into triggering the heap-based buffer overflow, causing the application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-2343:\n\tA heap-based buffer overflow was found in Vim in the ins_compl_add function in the insexpand.c file.
