			"title": "Amazon Linux AMI 2014.03 - ALAS-2022-1625: medium priority package update for libtiff",
			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-22844:\n\tA buffer overflow vulnerability was found in libtiff. This flaw allows an attacker with network access to pass specially crafted files, causing an application to halt or crash. The root cause of this issue was from the memcpy function in tif_unix.c.\n\nCVE-2022-0924:\n\tA heap buffer overflow flaw was found in Libtiffs' cpContigBufToSeparateBuf() function of the tiffcp.c file. This flaw allows an attacker with a crafted TIFF file to trigger a heap out-of-bounds read access issue, causing a crash that leads to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-0909:\n\tA floating-point exception (FPE) flaw was found in LibTIFF's computeOutputPixelOffsets() function in tiffcrop.c file. This flaw allows an attacker with a crafted TIFF file to trigger a divide-by-zero error, causing a crash that leads to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-0908:\n\tA flaw was found in LibTIFF where a NULL source pointer passed as an argument to the memcpy() function within the TIFFFetchNormalTag() in tif_dirread.c. This flaw allows an attacker with a crafted TIFF file to cause a crash that leads to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-0907:\n\tA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in Libtiff. This flaw allows an attacker with a crafted TIFF file to cause a crash that leads to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-0865:\n\tA reachable assertion failure was found in libtiff's JBIG functionality. This flaw allows an attacker who can submit a crafted file to an application linked with libtiff and using the JBIG functionality, causes a crash via an assertion failure, leading to a denial of service. The exact mechanism and conditions around this issue are dependent on how the application uses libtiff.\n\nCVE-2022-0562:\n\tA flaw was found in libtiff where a NULL source pointer passed as an argument to the memcpy() function within the TIFFReadDirectory() in tif_dirread.c. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit this vulnerability via a crafted TIFF file, causing a crash and leading to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-0561:\n\tA flaw was found in libtiff where a NULL source pointer passed as an argument to the memcpy() function within the TIFFFetchStripThing() in tif_dirread.c. This flaw allows an attacker with a crafted TIFF file to exploit this flaw, causing a crash and leading to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2020-35524:\n\tA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in libtiff in the handling of TIFF images in libtiff's TIFF2PDF tool. A specially crafted TIFF file can lead to arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2020-35523:\n\tAn integer overflow flaw was found in libtiff that exists in the tif_getimage.c file. This flaw allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code when a user opens a crafted TIFF file. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2020-35522:\n\tIn LibTIFF, there is a memory malloc failure in tif_pixarlog.c. A crafted TIFF document can lead to an abort, resulting in a remote denial of service attack.\n\nCVE-2020-35521:\n\tA flaw was found in libtiff. Due to a memory allocation failure in tif_read.c, a crafted TIFF file can lead to an abort, resulting in denial of service.\n\nCVE-2016-9532:\n\tInteger overflow in the writeBufferToSeparateStrips function in tiffcrop.c in LibTIFF before 4.0.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted tif file.\n",
