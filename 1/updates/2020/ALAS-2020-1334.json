			"title": "Amazon Linux AMI 2014.03 - ALAS-2020-1334: important priority package update for 389-ds-base",
			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2019-3883:\n\tIt was found that encrypted connections did not honor the &#039;ioblocktimeout&#039; parameter to end blocking requests. As a result, an unauthenticated attacker could repeatedly start a sufficient number of encrypted connections to block all workers, resulting in a denial of service.\nIn 389-ds-base up to version 1.4.1.2, requests are handled by workers threads. Each sockets will be waited by the worker for at most 'ioblocktimeout' seconds. However this timeout applies only for un-encrypted requests. Connections using SSL/TLS are not taking this timeout into account during reads, and may hang longer.An unauthenticated attacker could repeatedly create hanging LDAP requests to hang all the workers, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n1693612: \nCVE-2019-3883 389-ds-base: DoS via hanging secured connections\n    \n1693612: \nCVE-2019-3883 389-ds-base: DoS via hanging secured connections\n\nCVE-2019-14824:\n\tA flaw was found in the 'deref' plugin of 389-ds-base where it could use the 'search' permission to display attribute values. In some configurations, this could allow an authenticated attacker to view private attributes, such as password hashes.\n1747448: \nCVE-2019-14824 389-ds-base: Read permission check bypass via the deref plugin\n    \n\nCVE-2019-10224:\n\tA flaw has been found in 389-ds-base versions 1.4.x.x before 1.4.1.3. When executed in verbose mode, the dscreate and dsconf commands may display sensitive information, such as the Directory Manager password. An attacker, able to see the screen or record the terminal standard error output, could use this flaw to gain sensitive information.\n1677147: \nCVE-2019-10224 389-ds-base: using dscreate in verbose mode results in information disclosure\n    \n\nCVE-2018-10871:\n\t389-ds-base before versions 1.3.8.5, 1.4.0.12 is vulnerable to a Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information. By default, when the Replica and/or retroChangeLog plugins are enabled, 389-ds-base stores passwords in plaintext format in their respective changelog files. An attacker with sufficiently high privileges, such as root or Directory Manager, can query these files in order to retrieve plaintext passwords.\n1591480: \nCVE-2018-10871 389-ds-base: replication and the Retro Changelog plugin store plaintext password by default\n    \n",
