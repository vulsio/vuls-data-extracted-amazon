			"title": "Amazon Linux - ALAS-2012-133: medium priority package update for kernel",
			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2012-3552:\n\tRace condition in the IP implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.0 might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (slab corruption and system crash) by sending packets to an application that sets socket options during the handling of network traffic.\n853465: \nCVE-2012-3552 kernel: net: slab corruption due to improper synchronization around inet-&gt;opt\n* A race condition was found in the way access to inet->opt ip_options was synchronized in the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite implementation. Depending on the network facing applications running on the system, a remote attacker could possibly trigger this flaw to cause a denial of service. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service regardless of the applications the system runs.\n* A race condition in the way access to inet->opt ip_options was synchronized in the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite implementation. Depending on the network facing applications running on the system, a remote attacker could possibly trigger this flaw to cause a denial of service. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service regardless of the applications the system runs.\n\nCVE-2012-3430:\n\t820039: \nCVE-2012-3430 kernel: recv{from,msg}() on an rds socket can leak kernel memory\n* A flaw was found in the way the msg_namelen variable in the rds_recvmsg() function of the Linux kernel's Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation was initialized. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to leak kernel stack memory to user-space.\n\nCVE-2012-2390:\n\tMemory leak in mm/hugetlb.c in the Linux kernel before 3.4.2 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or system crash) via invalid MAP_HUGETLB mmap operations.\n824345: \nCVE-2012-2390 kernel: huge pages: memory leak on mmap failure\n* A memory leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem handled resource clean up in the mmap() failure path when the MAP_HUGETLB flag was set. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2012-2384:\n\tInteger overflow in the i915_gem_do_execbuffer function in drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem_execbuffer.c in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.3.5 on 32-bit platforms allows local users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ioctl call.\n824178: \nCVE-2012-2384 kernel: drm/i915: integer overflow in i915_gem_do_execbuffer()\n* An integer overflow flaw was found in the i915_gem_do_execbuffer() function in the Intel i915 driver in the Linux kernel. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected 32-bit systems.\n\nCVE-2012-2313:\n\tThe rio_ioctl function in drivers/net/ethernet/dlink/dl2k.c in the Linux kernel before 3.3.7 does not restrict access to the SIOCSMIIREG command, which allows local users to write data to an Ethernet adapter via an ioctl call.\n818820: \nCVE-2012-2313 kernel: unfiltered netdev rio_ioctl access by users\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's dl2k driver, used by certain D-Link Gigabit Ethernet adapters, restricted IOCTLs. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to issue potentially harmful IOCTLs, which could cause Ethernet adapters using the dl2k driver to malfunction (for example, losing network connectivity).\n",
