			"title": "Amazon Linux - ALAS-2013-148: medium priority package update for kernel nvidia",
			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2012-5517:\n\tThe online_pages function in mm/memory_hotplug.c in the Linux kernel before 3.6 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact in opportunistic circumstances by using memory that was hot-added by an administrator.\n875374: \nCVE-2012-5517 kernel: mm/hotplug: failure in propagating hot-added memory to other nodes\n* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way a new node's hot added memory was propagated to other nodes' zonelists. By utilizing this newly added memory from one of the remaining nodes, a local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2012-4565:\n\t871848: \nCVE-2012-4565 kernel: net: divide by zero in tcp algorithm illinois\n* A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the TCP Illinois congestion control algorithm implementation in the Linux kernel. If the TCP Illinois congestion control algorithm were in use (the sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control variable set to \"illinois\"), a local, unprivileged user could trigger this flaw and cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2012-4444:\n\tThe ip6_frag_queue function in net/ipv6/reassembly.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36 allows remote attackers to bypass intended network restrictions via overlapping IPv6 fragments.\n874835: \nCVE-2012-4444 kernel: net: acceptation of overlapping ipv6 fragments\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation handled overlapping, fragmented IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to bypass protection mechanisms (such as a firewall or intrusion detection system (IDS)) when sending network packets to a target system.\n\nCVE-2012-2375:\n\tThe __nfs4_get_acl_uncached function in fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c in the NFSv4 implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.3.2 uses an incorrect length variable during a copy operation, which allows remote NFS servers to cause a denial of service (OOPS) by sending an excessive number of bitmap words in an FATTR4_ACL reply.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-4131.\n822869: \nCVE-2012-2375 kernel: incomplete fix for CVE-2011-4131\n* It was found that the RHSA-2012:0862 update did not correctly fix the CVE-2011-4131 issue. A malicious Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) server could return a crafted reply to a GETACL request, causing a denial of service on the client.\n\nCVE-2012-2100:\n\tThe ext4_fill_flex_info function in fs/ext4/super.c in the Linux kernel before 3.2.2, on the x86 platform and unspecified other platforms, allows user-assisted remote attackers to trigger inconsistent filesystem-groups data and possibly cause a denial of service via a malformed ext4 filesystem containing a super block with a large FLEX_BG group size (aka s_log_groups_per_flex value).  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-4307.\n809687: \nCVE-2012-2100 kernel: ext4: fix inconsistency in ext4_fill_flex_info()\n* It was found that the initial release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 did not correctly fix the CVE-2009-4307 issue, a divide-by-zero flaw in the ext4 file system code. A local, unprivileged user with the ability to mount an ext4 file system could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.\n* It was found that the RHSA-2010:0178 update did not correctly fix the CVE-2009-4307 issue, a divide-by-zero flaw in the ext4 file system code. A local, unprivileged user with the ability to mount an ext4 file system could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.\n",
