			"title": "Amazon Linux AMI 2014.03 - ALAS-2018-973: medium priority package update for tomcat80",
			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2018-1305:\n\tSecurity constraints defined by annotations of Servlets in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.4, 8.5.0 to 8.5.27, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.84 were only applied once a Servlet had been loaded. Because security constraints defined in this way apply to the URL pattern and any URLs below that point, it was possible - depending on the order Servlets were loaded - for some security constraints not to be applied. This could have exposed resources to users who were not authorised to access them.\n1548282: \nCVE-2018-1305 tomcat: Late application of security constraints can lead to resource exposure for unauthorised users\n\nCVE-2018-1304:\n\tThe URL pattern of &quot;&quot; (the empty string) which exactly maps to the context root was not correctly handled in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.4, 8.5.0 to 8.5.27, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.84 when used as part of a security constraint definition. This caused the constraint to be ignored. It was, therefore, possible for unauthorised users to gain access to web application resources that should have been protected. Only security constraints with a URL pattern of the empty string were affected.\n1548289: \nCVE-2018-1304 tomcat: Incorrect handling of empty string URL in security constraints can lead to unintended exposure of resources\n\nCVE-2017-15706:\n\tAs part of the fix for bug 61201, the documentation for Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M22 to 9.0.1, 8.5.16 to 8.5.23, 8.0.45 to 8.0.47 and 7.0.79 to 7.0.82 included an updated description of the search algorithm used by the CGI Servlet to identify which script to execute. The update was not correct. As a result, some scripts may have failed to execute as expected and other scripts may have been executed unexpectedly. Note that the behaviour of the CGI servlet has remained unchanged in this regard. It is only the documentation of the behaviour that was wrong and has been corrected.\n1540828: \nCVE-2017-15706 tomcat: Incorrect documentation of CGI Servlet search algorithm may lead to misconfiguration\n",
