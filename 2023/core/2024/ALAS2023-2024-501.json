			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2024-21626:\n\tAWS is aware of CVE-2024-21626, an issue affecting the runc component of several open source container management systems. Under certain conditions, an actor could leverage a specially crafted container or container configuration to access files or directories outside the container's file system namespace.\n\nAn updated version of runc that addresses the issue is available for Amazon Linux 1 (runc-1.1.11-1.0.amzn1), Amazon Linux 2 (runc-1.1.11-1.amzn2) and for Amazon Linux 2023 (runc-1.1.11-1.amzn2023). AWS recommends that customers using runc or any container-related software apply those updates or a newer version.\n\nCVE-2023-39326:\n\tA malicious HTTP sender can use chunk extensions to cause a receiver reading from a request or response body to read many more bytes from the network than are in the body. A malicious HTTP client can further exploit this to cause a server to automatically read a large amount of data (up to about 1GiB) when a handler fails to read the entire body of a request. Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which permit including additional metadata in a request or response body sent using the chunked encoding. The net/http chunked encoding reader discards this metadata. A sender can exploit this by inserting a large metadata segment with each byte transferred. The chunk reader now produces an error if the ratio of real body to encoded bytes grows too small.\n",
