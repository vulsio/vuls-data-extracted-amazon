				"title": "Amazon Linux 2023 - ALAS2023-2024-647: Important priority package update for ecs-service-connect-agent",
				"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2024-34364:\n\tEnvoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. Envoy exposed an out-of-memory (OOM) vector from the mirror response, since async HTTP client will buffer the response with an unbounded buffer.\n\nCVE-2024-34363:\n\tEnvoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. Due to how Envoy invoked the nlohmann JSON library, the library could throw an uncaught exception from downstream data if incomplete UTF-8 strings were serialized. The uncaught exception would cause Envoy to crash.\n\nCVE-2024-34362:\n\tEnvoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. There is a use-after-free in `HttpConnectionManager` (HCM) with `EnvoyQuicServerStream` that can crash Envoy. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a request without `FIN`, then a `RESET_STREAM` frame, and then after receiving the response, closing the connection.\n\nCVE-2024-32976:\n\tEnvoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. Envoyproxy with a Brotli filter can get into an endless loop during decompression of Brotli data with extra input.\n\nCVE-2024-32975:\n\tEnvoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. There is a crash at `QuicheDataReader::PeekVarInt62Length()`. It is caused by integer underflow in the `QuicStreamSequencerBuffer::PeekRegion()` implementation.\n\nCVE-2024-32974:\n\tEnvoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. A crash was observed in `EnvoyQuicServerStream::OnInitialHeadersComplete()` with following call stack. It is a use-after-free caused by QUICHE continuing push request headers after `StopReading()` being called on the stream. As after `StopReading()`, the HCM's `ActiveStream` might have already be destroyed and any up calls from QUICHE could potentially cause use after free.\n\nCVE-2024-32475:\n\tEnvoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. When an upstream TLS cluster is used with `auto_sni` enabled, a request containing a `host`/`:authority` header longer than 255 characters triggers an abnormal termination of Envoy process. Envoy does not gracefully handle an error when setting SNI for outbound TLS connection. The error can occur when Envoy attempts to use the `host`/`:authority` header value longer than 255 characters as SNI for outbound TLS connection. SNI length is limited to 255 characters per the standard. Envoy always expects this operation to succeed and abnormally aborts the process when it fails. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.30.1, 1.29.4, 1.28.3, and 1.27.5.\n\nCVE-2024-30255:\n\tEnvoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. The HTTP/2 protocol stack in Envoy versions prior to 1.29.3, 1.28.2, 1.27.4, and 1.26.8 are vulnerable to CPU exhaustion due to flood of CONTINUATION frames. Envoy's HTTP/2 codec allows the client to send an unlimited number of CONTINUATION frames even after exceeding Envoy's header map limits. This allows an attacker to send a sequence of CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS bit set causing CPU utilization, consuming approximately 1 core per 300Mbit/s of traffic and culminating in denial of service through CPU exhaustion. Users should upgrade to version 1.29.3, 1.28.2, 1.27.4, or 1.26.8 to mitigate the effects of the CONTINUATION flood. As a workaround, disable HTTP/2 protocol for downstream connections.\n\nCVE-2024-23326:\n\tEnvoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. A theoretical request smuggling vulnerability exists through Envoy if a server can be tricked into adding an upgrade header into a response. Per RFC https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-6.7 a server sends 101 when switching protocols. Envoy incorrectly accepts a 200 response from a server when requesting a protocol upgrade, but 200 does not indicate protocol switch. This opens up the possibility of request smuggling through Envoy if the server can be tricked into adding the upgrade header to the response.\n",
