			"title": "Amazon Linux 2023 - ALAS2023-2023-198: Important priority package update for c-ares",
			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-32067:\n\tDenial of Service.\n\nAttack Steps:\n\nThe target resolver sends a query\nThe attacker forges a malformed UDP packet with a length of 0 and returns them to the target resolver\nThe target resolver erroneously interprets the 0 length as a graceful shutdown of the connection. (this is only valid for TCP connections, UDP is connection-less)\nCurrent resolution fails, DoS attack is achieved.\n\nCVE-2023-31147:\n\tInsufficient randomness in generation of DNS query IDs\n\nWhen /dev/urandom or RtlGenRandom() are unavailable, c-ares uses rand() to generate random numbers used for DNS query ids. This is not a CSPRNG, and it is also not seeded by srand() so will generate predictable output.\nInput from the random number generator is fed into a non-compilant RC4 implementation and may not be as strong as the original RC4 implementation.\nNo attempt is made to look for modern OS-provided CSPRNGs like arc4random() that is widely available.\n\nCVE-2023-31130:\n\tares_inet_net_pton() is vulnerable to a buffer underflow for certain ipv6 addresses, in particular \"0::00:00:00/2\" was found to cause an issue. C-ares only uses this function internally for configuration purposes which would require an administrator to configure such an address via ares_set_sortlist().\n\nHowever, users may externally use ares_inet_net_pton() for other purposes and thus be vulnerable to more severe issues.\n\nCVE-2023-31124:\n\tWhen cross-compiling c-ares and using the autotools build system, CARES_RANDOM_FILE will not be set, as seen when cross compiling aarch64 android. This will downgrade to using rand() as a fallback which could allow an attacker to take advantage of the lack of entropy by not using a CSPRNG.\n\nCVE-2022-4904:\n\tA flaw was found in the c-ares package. The ares_set_sortlist is missing checks about the validity of the input string, which allows a possible arbitrary length stack overflow. This issue may cause a denial of service or a limited impact on confidentiality and integrity.\n",
