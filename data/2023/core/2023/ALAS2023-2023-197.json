			"title": "Amazon Linux 2023 - ALAS2023-2023-197: Important priority package update for wireshark",
			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-2952:\n\tXRA dissector infinite loop in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.5 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.13 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\nCVE-2023-2879:\n\tGDSDB infinite loop in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.5 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.13 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\nCVE-2023-2858:\n\tNetScaler file parser crash in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.5 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.13 allows denial of service via crafted capture file\n\nCVE-2023-2857:\n\tA vulnerability was found in wireshark versions between 4.0.0 to 4.0.5 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.13. The attacker would need the victim to open a maliciously crafted wireshark trace file, which would cause wireshark to crash.\n\nCVE-2023-2856:\n\tVMS TCPIPtrace file parser crash in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.5 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.13 allows denial of service via crafted capture file\n\nCVE-2023-2855:\n\tCandump log parser crash in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.5 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.13 allows denial of service via crafted capture file\n\nCVE-2023-2854:\n\tA vulnerability exists in wireshark version 4.0.0 to 4.0.5 which would allow a remote attacker to crash wireshark by either injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing a user to read a malformed packet trace file.\n\nCVE-2023-0668:\n\tDue to failure in validating the length provided by an attacker-crafted IEEE-C37.118 packet, Wireshark version 4.0.5 and prior, by default, is susceptible to a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly code execution in the context of the process running Wireshark. CVE-2023-0668 appears to be an instance of CWE-125.\n\nNOTE: https://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2023-19.html\nNOTE: https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/19087\n\nCVE-2023-0666:\n\tDue to failure in validating the length provided by an attacker-crafted RTPS packet, Wireshark version between 4.0.0 to 4.0.5, by default, is susceptible to a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly code execution in the context of the process running\nWireshark.\nNOTE: https://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2023-18.html\nNOTE: https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/19085\n",
