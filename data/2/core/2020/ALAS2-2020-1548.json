			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2020-24606:\n\tSquid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4 allows a trusted peer to perform Denial of Service by consuming all available CPU cycles during handling of a crafted Cache Digest response message. This only occurs when cache_peer is used with the cache digests feature. The problem exists because peerDigestHandleReply() livelocking in peer_digest.cc mishandles EOF.\n1871705: CVE-2020-24606 squid: Improper input validation could result in a DoS\n\nCVE-2020-15811:\n\tA flaw was found in squid. Due to incorrect data validation, an HTTP Request Splitting attack against HTTP and HTTPS traffic is possible leading to cache poisoning. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n1871702: CVE-2020-15811 squid: HTTP Request Splitting could result in cache poisoning\n\nCVE-2020-15810:\n\tA flaw was found in squid. Due to incorrect data validation, a HTTP Request Smuggling attack against HTTP and HTTPS traffic is possible leading to cache poisoning.
