				"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-22764:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nMozilla developers and community members Paul Adenot and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 96 and Firefox ESR 91.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2022-22763:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nWhen a worker is shutdown, it was possible to cause script to run late in the lifecycle, at a point after where it should not be possible.\n\nCVE-2022-22761:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nWeb-accessible extension pages (pages with a moz-extension:// scheme) were not correctly enforcing the frame-ancestors directive when it was used in the Web Extension\\'s Content Security Policy.\n\nCVE-2022-22760:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nWhen importing resources using Web Workers, error messages would distinguish the difference between application/javascript responses and non-script responses. This could have been abused to learn information cross-origin.\n\nCVE-2022-22759:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nIf a document created a sandboxed iframe without allow-scripts, and subsequently appended an element to the iframe's document that e.g. had a JavaScript event handler - the event handler would have run despite the iframe's sandbox.\n\nCVE-2022-22756:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nIf a user was convinced to drag and drop an image to their desktop or other folder, the resulting object could have been changed into an executable script which would have run arbitrary code after the user clicked on it.\n\nCVE-2022-22754:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nIf a user installed an extension of a particular type, the extension could have auto-updated itself and while doing so, bypass the prompt which grants the new version the new requested permissions.\n\nCVE-2022-22751:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nMozilla developers Calixte Denizet, Kershaw Chang, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Gabriele Svelto, Tyson Smith, Simon Giesecke, and Steve Fink reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 95 and Firefox ESR 91.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2022-22748:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nMalicious websites could have confused Thunderbird into showing the wrong origin when asking to launch a program and handling an external URL protocol.\n\nCVE-2022-22747:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nAfter accepting an untrusted certificate, handling an empty pkcs7 sequence as part of the certificate data could have lead to a crash. This crash is believed to be unexploitable.\n\nCVE-2022-22745:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: \n\nSecuritypolicyviolation events could have leaked cross-origin information for frame-ancestors violations\n\nCVE-2022-22743:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nWhen navigating from inside an iframe while requesting fullscreen access, an attacker-controlled tab could have made the browser unable to leave fullscreen mode.\n\nCVE-2022-22742:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nWhen inserting text while in edit mode, some characters might have lead to out-of-bounds memory access causing a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2022-22741:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nWhen resizing a popup while requesting fullscreen access, the popup would have become unable to leave fullscreen mode.\n\nCVE-2022-22740:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nCertain network request objects were freed too early when releasing a network request handle. This could have lead to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2022-22739:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nMalicious websites could have tricked users into accepting launching a program to handle an external URL protocol.\n\nCVE-2022-22738:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nApplying a CSS filter effect could have accessed out of bounds memory. This could have lead to a heap-buffer-overflow causing a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2022-22737:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nConstructing audio sinks could have lead to a race condition when playing audio files and closing windows. This could have lead to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2021-43529:\n\tA flaw was found in Thunderbird, which is vulnerable to the heap overflow described in CVE-2021-43527 when processing S/MIME messages. Thunderbird versions 91.3.0 and later will not call the vulnerable code when processing S/MIME messages that contain certificates with DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS signatures.\n\nCVE-2021-4140:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nIt was possible to construct specific XSLT markup that would be able to bypass an iframe sandbox.\n\nCVE-2021-38503:\n\tThe iframe sandbox rules were not correctly applied to XSLT stylesheets, allowing an iframe to bypass restrictions such as executing scripts or navigating the top-level frame. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.\n\nCVE-2021-38502:\n\tThunderbird ignored the configuration to require STARTTLS security for an SMTP connection. A MITM could perform a downgrade attack to intercept transmitted messages, or could take control of the authenticated session to execute SMTP commands chosen by the MITM. If an unprotected authentication method was configured, the MITM could obtain the authentication credentials, too. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.2.\n\nCVE-2021-38501:\n\tMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 92 and Firefox ESR 91.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 93, Thunderbird < 91.2, and Firefox ESR < 91.2.\n\nCVE-2021-38500:\n\tMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 92 and Firefox ESR 91.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.15, Thunderbird < 91.2, Firefox ESR < 91.2, Firefox ESR < 78.15, and Firefox < 93.\n\nCVE-2021-38498:\n\tDuring process shutdown, a document could have caused a use-after-free of a languages service object, leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 93, Thunderbird < 91.2, and Firefox ESR < 91.2.\n\nCVE-2021-38497:\n\tThrough use of reportValidity() and window.open(), a plain-text validation message could have been overlaid on another origin, leading to possible user confusion and spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 93, Thunderbird < 91.2, and Firefox ESR < 91.2.\n\nCVE-2021-38496:\n\tDuring operations on MessageTasks, a task may have been removed while it was still scheduled, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.15, Thunderbird < 91.2, Firefox ESR < 91.2, Firefox ESR < 78.15, and Firefox < 93.\n\nCVE-2021-32810:\n\tcrossbeam-deque is a package of work-stealing deques for building task schedulers when programming in Rust. In versions prior to 0.7.4 and 0.8.0, the result of the race condition is that one or more tasks in the worker queue can be popped twice instead of other tasks that are forgotten and never popped. If tasks are allocated on the heap, this can cause double free and a memory leak. If not, this still can cause a logical bug. Crates using `Stealer::steal`, `Stealer::steal_batch`, or `Stealer::steal_batch_and_pop` are affected by this issue. This has been fixed in crossbeam-deque 0.8.1 and 0.7.4.\n",
