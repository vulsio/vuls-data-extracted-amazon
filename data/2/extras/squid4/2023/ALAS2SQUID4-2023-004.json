			"title": "Amazon Linux 2 - Squid4 2.0 - ALAS2SQUID4-2023-004: medium priority package update for squid",
			"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 - Squid4 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-33620:\n\tSquid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6 allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (affecting availability to all clients) via an HTTP response. The issue trigger is a header that can be expected to exist in HTTP traffic without any malicious intent by the server.\n\nCVE-2021-31808:\n\tAn issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to an input-validation bug, it is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack (against all clients using the proxy). A client sends an HTTP Range request to trigger this.\n\nCVE-2021-31807:\n\tAn issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. An integer overflow problem allows a remote server to achieve Denial of Service when delivering responses to HTTP Range requests. The issue trigger is a header that can be expected to exist in HTTP traffic without any malicious intent.\n\nCVE-2021-31806:\n\tAn issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to a memory-management bug, it is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack (against all clients using the proxy) via HTTP Range request processing.\n\nCVE-2021-28662:\n\tAn issue was discovered in Squid 4.x before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. If a remote server sends a certain response header over HTTP or HTTPS, there is a denial of service. This header can plausibly occur in benign network traffic.\n\nCVE-2021-28652:\n\tAn issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to incorrect parser validation, it allows a Denial of Service attack against the Cache Manager API. This allows a trusted client to trigger memory leaks that. over time, lead to a Denial of Service via an unspecified short query string. This attack is limited to clients with Cache Manager API access privilege.\n\nCVE-2021-28651:\n\tAn issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to a buffer-management bug, it allows a denial of service. When resolving a request with the urn: scheme, the parser leaks a small amount of memory. However, there is an unspecified attack methodology that can easily trigger a large amount of memory consumption.\n\nCVE-2021-28116:\n\tSquid through 4.14 and 5.x through 5.0.5, in some configurations, allows information disclosure because of an out-of-bounds read in WCCP protocol data. This can be leveraged as part of a chain for remote code execution as nobody.\n",
