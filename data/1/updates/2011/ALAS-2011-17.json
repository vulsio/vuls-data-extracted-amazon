				"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2011-0633:\n\tThe Net::HTTPS module in libwww-perl (LWP) before 6.00, as used in WWW::Mechanize, LWP::UserAgent, and other products, when running in environments that do not set the If-SSL-Cert-Subject header, does not enable full validation of SSL certificates by default, which allows remote attackers to spoof servers via man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks involving hostnames that are not properly validated. NOTE: it could be argued that this is a design limitation of the Net::HTTPS API, and separate implementations should be independently assigned CVE identifiers for not working around this limitation. However, because this API was modified within LWP, a single CVE identifier has been assigned.\nThe Net::HTTPS module in libwww-perl (LWP) before 6.00, as used in WWW::Mechanize, LWP::UserAgent, and other products, when running in environments that do not set the If-SSL-Cert-Subject header, does not enable full validation of SSL certificates by default, which allows remote attackers to spoof servers via man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks involving hostnames that are not properly validated.
