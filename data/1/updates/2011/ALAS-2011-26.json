				"title": "Amazon Linux - ALAS-2011-26: medium priority package update for kernel",
				"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2011-4326:\n\t* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled fragmented IPv6 UDP datagrams over the bridge with UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) functionality on. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2011-4132:\n\t* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Journaling Block Device (JBD). A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system by mounting a specially-crafted ext3 or ext4 disk.\n* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Journaling Block Device (JBD). A local attacker could use this flaw to crash the system by mounting a specially-crafted ext3 or ext4 disk.\n\nCVE-2011-4110:\n\t* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's key management facility handled user-defined key types. A local, unprivileged user could use the keyctl utility to cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2011-3593:\n\t* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled VLAN 0 frames with the priority tag set. When using certain network drivers, an attacker on the local network could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2011-3363:\n\t* A flaw was found in the way CIFS shares with DFS referrals at their root were handled. An attacker on the local network who is able to deploy a malicious CIFS server could create a CIFS network share that, when mounted, would cause the client system to crash.\n* A flaw was found in the way CIFS (Common Internet File System) shares with DFS referrals at their root were handled. An attacker on the local network who is able to deploy a malicious CIFS server could create a CIFS network share that, when mounted, would cause the client system to crash.\n\nCVE-2011-3359:\n\t* A flaw was found in the b43 driver in the Linux kernel. If a system had an active wireless interface that uses the b43 driver, an attacker able to send a specially-crafted frame to that interface could cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2011-3353:\n\t* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) implementation. A local user in the fuse group who has access to mount a FUSE file system could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2011-3191:\n\t* A signedness issue was found in the Linux kernel's CIFS (Common Internet File System) implementation. A malicious CIFS server could send a specially-crafted response to a directory read request that would result in a denial of service or privilege escalation on a system that has a CIFS share mounted.\n* A malicious CIFS (Common Internet File System) server could send a specially-crafted response to a directory read request that would result in a denial of service or privilege escalation on a system that has a CIFS share mounted.\n\nCVE-2011-3188:\n\t* The way IPv4 and IPv6 protocol sequence numbers and fragment IDs were generated could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to inject packets and possibly hijack connections. Protocol sequence numbers and fragment IDs are now more random.\n* IPv4 and IPv6 protocol sequence number and fragment ID generation could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to inject packets and possibly hijack connections. Protocol sequence number and fragment IDs are now more random.\n\nCVE-2011-2905:\n\t* It was found that the perf tool, a part of the Linux kernel's Performance Events implementation, could load its configuration file from the current working directory. If a local user with access to the perf tool were tricked into running perf in a directory that contains a specially-crafted configuration file, it could cause perf to overwrite arbitrary files and directories accessible to that user.\n\nCVE-2011-2699:\n\t* IPv6 fragment identification value generation could allow a remote attacker to disrupt a target system's networking, preventing legitimate users from accessing its services.\n\nCVE-2011-2494:\n\t* The I/O statistics from the taskstats subsystem could be read without any restrictions. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to gather confidential information, such as the length of a password used in a process.\n\nCVE-2011-1577:\n\tHeap-based buffer overflow in the is_gpt_valid function in fs/partitions/efi.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.38 and earlier allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (OOPS) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted size of the EFI GUID partition-table header on removable media.\n* A heap overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's EFI GUID Partition Table (GPT) implementation. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by mounting a disk that contains specially-crafted partition tables.\n* A heap overflow flaw in the Linux kernel's EFI GUID Partition Table (GPT) implementation could allow a local attacker to cause a denial of service by mounting a disk that contains specially-crafted partition tables.\n\nCVE-2011-1162:\n\t* A flaw in the way memory containing security-related data was handled in tpm_read() could allow a local, unprivileged user to read the results of a previously run TPM command.\n",
