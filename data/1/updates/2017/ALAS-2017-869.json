				"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2017-10243:\n\tIt was discovered that the wsdlimport tool in the JAX-WS component of OpenJDK did not use secure XML parser settings when parsing WSDL XML documents. A specially crafted WSDL document could cause wsdlimport to use an excessive amount of CPU and memory, open connections to other hosts, or leak information.\n1472666: \nCVE-2017-10243 OpenJDK: insecure XML parsing in wsdlimport (JAX-WS, 8182054)\n\nCVE-2017-10135:\n\tA covert timing channel flaw was found in the PKCS#8 implementation in the JCE component of OpenJDK. A remote attacker able to make a Java application repeatedly compare PKCS#8 key against an attacker controlled value could possibly use this flaw to determine the key via a timing side channel.\n1471871: \nCVE-2017-10135 OpenJDK: PKCS#8 implementation timing attack (JCE, 8176760)\n\nCVE-2017-10116:\n\tIt was discovered that the LDAPCertStore class in the Security component of OpenJDK followed LDAP referrals to arbitrary URLs. A specially crafted LDAP referral URL could cause LDAPCertStore to communicate with non-LDAP servers.\n1471738: \nCVE-2017-10116 OpenJDK: LDAPCertStore following referrals to non-LDAP URLs (Security, 8176067)\n\nCVE-2017-10115:\n\tA covert timing channel flaw was found in the DSA implementation in the JCE component of OpenJDK. A remote attacker able to make a Java application generate DSA signatures on demand could possibly use this flaw to extract certain information about the used key via a timing side channel.\n1471851: \nCVE-2017-10115 OpenJDK: DSA implementation timing attack (JCE, 8175106)\n\nCVE-2017-10110:\n\tVulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: AWT). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u151, 7u141 and 8u131. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE.
