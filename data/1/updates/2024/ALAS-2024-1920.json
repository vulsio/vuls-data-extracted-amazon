				"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-49569:\n\tA path traversal vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to v5.11. This vulnerability allows an attacker to create and amend files across the filesystem. In the worse case scenario, remote code execution could be achieved.\n\nApplications are only affected if they are using the  ChrootOS https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/osfs#ChrootOS , which is the default when using \"Plain\" versions of Open and Clone funcs (e.g. PlainClone). Applications using  BoundOS https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/osfs#BoundOS  or in-memory filesystems are not affected by this issue.\nThis is a go-git implementation issue and does not affect the upstream git cli.\n\nCVE-2023-49568:\n\tA denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to v5.11. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform denial of service attacks by providing specially crafted responses from a Git server which triggers resource exhaustion in go-git clients.\n\nApplications using only the in-memory filesystem supported by go-git are not affected by this vulnerability.\nThis is a go-git implementation issue and does not affect the upstream git cli.\n\nCVE-2023-39326:\n\tA malicious HTTP sender can use chunk extensions to cause a receiver reading from a request or response body to read many more bytes from the network than are in the body. A malicious HTTP client can further exploit this to cause a server to automatically read a large amount of data (up to about 1GiB) when a handler fails to read the entire body of a request. Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which permit including additional metadata in a request or response body sent using the chunked encoding. The net/http chunked encoding reader discards this metadata. A sender can exploit this by inserting a large metadata segment with each byte transferred. The chunk reader now produces an error if the ratio of real body to encoded bytes grows too small.\n\nCVE-2023-39325:\n\tThe HTTP/2 protocol allows a denial of service (server resource consumption) because request cancellation can reset many streams quickly, as exploited in the wild in August through October 2023.\n",
