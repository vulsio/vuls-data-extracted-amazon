				"title": "Amazon Linux AMI 2014.03 - ALAS-2018-951: important priority package update for curl",
				"description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2018-1000007:\n\tlibcurl 7.1 through 7.57.0 might accidentally leak authentication data to third parties. When asked to send custom headers in its HTTP requests, libcurl will send that set of headers first to the host in the initial URL but also, if asked to follow redirects and a 30X HTTP response code is returned, to the host mentioned in URL in the `Location:` response header value. Sending the same set of headers to subsequest hosts is in particular a problem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` headers, as this header often contains privacy sensitive information or data that could allow others to impersonate the libcurl-using client&#039;s request.\n1537125: \nCVE-2018-1000007 curl: HTTP authentication leak in redirects\n\nCVE-2018-1000005:\n\tlibcurl 7.49.0 to and including 7.57.0 contains an out bounds read in code handling HTTP/2 trailers. It was reported (https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an HTTP/2 trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one byte less than required. The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headers from the HTTP/2 trailer data once appended a string like `:` to the target buffer, while this was recently changed to `: ` (a space was added after the colon) but the following math wasn&#039;t updated correspondingly. When accessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or that the (too large) data gets passed to client write. This could lead to a denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.\n1536013: \nCVE-2018-1000005 curl: Out-of-bounds read in code handling HTTP/2 trailers\n",
